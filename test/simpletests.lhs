\label{sec:simpletests}

We now use the library QuickCheck to randomly generate input for our functions
and test some properties.

\begin{code}
module Main where

import Test.Hspec
import Test.QuickCheck
\end{code}

The following uses the HSpec library to define different tests.
Note that the first test is a specific test with fixed inputs.
The second and third test use QuickCheck.


To run the tests, use \verb|stack test|.

To also find out which part of your program is actually used for these tests,
run \verb|stack clean && stack test --coverage|. Then look for ``The coverage
report for ... is available at ... .html'' and open this file in your browser.
